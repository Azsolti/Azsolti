- 👋 Hi, I’m @Azsolti, im 33 and just got into programming. In my childhood i always wanted to know how computers and games/softwares work. How is it work that i press a button and
     the character is doing what i want to do with it. How to create worlds with whole ecosystems in it or just how is it work that im just pushing the mouse button and i can draw
     anything to the screen with it just as we all did in Paint back in the days.
     So the time has come, sooner or later but i'm here and i'm thirsty for everything that i can learn on this journey, the greatest dream and wonder of my childhood.
     
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Listening to music, i'm playing guitar since the age of 14 and a year ago i started drumming. I'm enjoying every moment of it. Music is the best thing
      that humanity has invented and i'm grateful that i can play on an instrument. If you, who read this and can't play, i'm telling you, it's never too late to learn and you 
      will never regret it, i promise :)
